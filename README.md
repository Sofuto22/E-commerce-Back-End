# E-commerce Back End

## Description

In this project I created a mysql database and back end application for an e-commerce site. This had a lot of routing which I am not super comfortable with but hopefully it came out okay. I am looking forward to feed back so I can edit and further my knowledge on these subjects.

## Installation

Run npm i

## Usage

Run source schema.sql
Run npm run seed
npm start
